\section{Royalties}

\subsection{} As consideration for this license, Licensee agrees to pay \csn\ a royalty of one percent (1\%) of gross revenues of all Licensed Products sold.

\subsection{} All royalties shall be paid quarterly within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter.

\subsection{} In the event of default in payment of any royalties due \csn\ under this Agreement, and if it becomes necessary for \csn\ to undertake legal action to collect such royalties, Licensee shall pay for all reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by \csn\ provided that the legal action undertaken by \csn\ results in a determination that Licensee owed \csn\ royalties under the terms of this Agreement.

\subsection{} On or before the last day of April, July, October, and January of each year, Licensee shall furnish \csn\ with a statement reporting gross revenues of Licensed Products bearing the Licensed Mark for the preceding quarter, with a calculation of royalties owed for those sales.

\section{Indemnification}

\subsection{} \csn\ assumes no liability to Licensee or third parties with respect to the performance characteristics of the Licensed Products manufactured or sold by Licensee. Licensee agrees to indemnify or hold harmless \csn, its officers, employees, and agents from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, damages, liabilities, and costs and expenses of every nature, including attorneys' fees, relating to or arising out of the manufacture or sale or use of the Licensed Products or from the use of the Licensed Mark on such products. This indemnification shall include, but is not limited to, any and all claims or suits for which either party is alleged or found to have been wholly or partially negligent.

\subsection{} Upon the termination of this Agreement by either party, all rights granted to Licensee shall revert to \csn, and Licensee shall make no claims as to such rights.

\subsection{} Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee agrees to immediately discontinue the use of the Licensed Mark.
